# Logflare Transport Core JS

This repo contains the core JS logic used for ingesting into the [Logflare service](https://logflare.app).

There are plans to rewrite this client package, hence it is not recommended to use this directly. We recommend using downstream packages such as [`pino-logflare`](https://github.com/Logflare/pino-logflare) instead.
